## 1. Project Description

In Pacita Abad‚Äôs vibrant and chaotic _Wheels of Fortune_, what I first perceived wasn‚Äôt festivity‚Äîbut life. Not a wheel of prayer, but an organism of fate: cellular, breathing, and writhing with alien logic.

_Original: Wheels of Fortune by Pacita Abad_

While the original quilted piece evokes celebration through vivid color rhythms, my digital reinterpretation detaches these motifs from fabric and human touch. Once translated into code and digital space, these visuals cease to be decorative‚Äîthey become **simulacra of living organisms**. They morph into nameless microorganisms that divide, swell, and pulse with a logic foreign to human understanding.

![Code Interpretation](assets/Original.JPG)
_The image after redrawing with code_

This is not a wheel powered by gears. This is a recursive, squirming spindle of fate‚Äî**the Spindle of Dread**. Inspired by Plato‚Äôs *Spindle of Necessity* which governed cosmic order, this version strips away rationality, emerging instead as a visceral, chaotic, and quasi-biological entity.

Using **Perlin noise**, I gave the shapes an irregular "breathing" quality, keeping them in a liminal state between motion and stasis. A handpicked palette mimics the look of poisonous fungi‚Äîbeautiful yet unsettling. When hovered, the shapes recoil, twitch, and darken to deep blues and purples‚Äîsignaling panic or necrosis. This interaction implies a reversal:

> Not that we fear fate‚Äîbut that fate might fear us.

This isn't horror by spectacle. It is subtle, invasive disquiet‚Äîproduced by proximity and observation. You aren‚Äôt just watching a wheel spin. You‚Äôre disturbing a system that feels.

## 2. How to Use

Upon loading the page, users are presented with a 520√ó520 animation canvas.

Key behaviors:
- Concentric rings pulsate using gradients
- Elliptical shapes rotate irregularly
- Circles expand and contract rhythmically

üñ±Ô∏è **Interactive Hover**
- Hover over any shape to trigger:
  - Contraction (shrinking)
  - Twitching motion
  - Color shift to dark purples/blues

Each refresh produces a unique output. No clicks or buttons‚Äîjust visual immersion and reaction.

## 3. My Animation Approach

### Code Modularization
Originally part of a group project in a single `sketch.js`, I refactored the code into modular files:
- `Ring.js`
- `EllipsePattern.js`
- `CirclePattern.js`

### üåÄ Rhythmic Motion
- **Perlin noise** drives:
  - Radius breathing
  - Angular wobble
  - Organic distortions

### üé® Controlled Chaos
- Used `random()` within a curated palette
- Avoided overly saturated or clashing colors
- Targeted a visual balance between vibrancy and discomfort

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Techniques
- `lerpColor()` for color gradients
- `clamp()` for value safety
- Class-based encapsulation for modular animation
- `randomSeed()` for reproducibility

### üöÄ Next Steps
Introduce deeper interactivity:
- Mouse click: switch themes or behaviors
- Cursor position: affect speed, growth, or tension

---

## 4. Animation Driver: Perlin Noise + Randomness

### Dual Strategy
- **Perlin noise** = organic flow (breathing, rotation)
- **Random** = dynamic disruption (color flicker)

Together they:
- Simulate life-like unpredictability
- Maintain controlled beauty with natural evolution
- Allow dynamic yet coherent visual experience

---

## 5. Animated Properties & Uniqueness

My animation stands out because it feels **alive**.

- Shapes **breathe** and **pulse** with Perlin noise
- Colors **shift unpredictably** but stay within bounds
- Forms **react emotionally** through hover-triggered behaviors

Compared to static or reactive-only animations, mine simulates **responsive living systems**‚Äîevocative of microbial or alien life.

## 6. Inspirations

### üé® Cultural & Philosophical
- **Pacita Abad‚Äôs Wheels of Fortune**: Hidden tension beneath celebration
- **Wheel of Fortune** in Western culture: Fortuna‚Äôs cycle of rise/fall, divine unpredictability
- **Plato‚Äôs Spindle of Necessity**: A metaphysical device controlling cosmic fate

My reinterpretation‚Äî**Spindle of Dread**‚Äîimagines fate as:
> A reactive, emotional entity‚Äînot a cold mechanism.

## 9. üì¶ External Tools & Techniques

### 1. `lerpColor()` ‚Äì Smooth Color Interpolation *(Beyond Course Scope)*

Although `lerp()` (linear interpolation) is commonly used, in this project I specifically applied **p5.js‚Äôs `lerpColor()`** function to generate smooth color transitions. This method was not included in the course material‚Äîit was introduced to me via a suggestion from ChatGPT.

#### ‚ú® Why I Chose It
I wanted the rotating ring shapes (`Ring` objects) to display fluid color gradients that resembled glowing or energetic auras. Simply using `random()` caused abrupt and jarring color changes. By contrast, `lerpColor()` enabled continuous, natural transitions between hues, creating a more immersive and aesthetically pleasing animation.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
The function `lerpColor(c1, c2, amt)` returns a color between `c1` and `c2`, where `amt` is a value between 0.0 and 1.0. Internally, it linearly interpolates each color channel (in RGB or HSB), creating a seamless blend.

**Formula:**  
`result = (1 - amt) * c1 + amt * c2` (applied per channel)

#### üß™ Example Code

![Preview](assets/LerpColorSample.png)

#### üé® Real Use Case
In my `Ring` class, I applied this same technique to transition through multiple colors as each ring rotated, enhancing the sense of motion, depth, and emotional intensity.

---

### 2. `clamp()` ‚Äì Value Bounding Utility *(Custom Function)*

The `clamp()` function is a fundamental math utility that ensures a value stays within a specified range. I implemented it to stabilize properties like radii, angles, and Perlin-noise-driven values. This function was also generated with the help of ChatGPT.

#### ‚ú® Why I Chose It
Dynamic values‚Äîespecially when driven by noise or randomness‚Äîcan easily drift outside desired visual limits. This often leads to objects that are oversized, distorted, or visually broken. By clamping those values, I ensured visual consistency and avoided instability in the animation.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
`clamp(value, min, max)` returns:
- `min` if `value < min`
- `max` if `value > max`
- `value` if within range

This ensures that the output always stays inside `[min, max]`.

#### üß™ Example Code

![Preview](assets/ClampSample.png)

#### üîß Real Use Case
In both the `Ring` and `CirclePattern` modules, I used `clamp()` to limit radius growth and suppress excessive jitter. This helped maintain compositional balance even under intense motion or transformation.

## 10. üîÅ Iterative Development & Refinement

### 1. üì¶ Initial Version ‚Äì Autonomous Animation Only

![Preview](assets/Iteration1.GIF)

In early user testing, I noticed that while the original deep blue background contributed to a feeling of pressure and unease, it also made some viewers feel excessively uncomfortable. I then switched the background to a brighter mustard yellow and tweaked the color palette‚Äîremoving overly saturated and visually jarring options.

These changes gave the work a more vibrant appearance, reminiscent of tropical fungi or deep-sea organisms with ‚Äútoxic warning‚Äù coloration. The discomfort wasn't reduced‚Äîinstead, it became more subtle and unsettling, masked behind deceptively cheerful colors and spasmodic reactions.

At the same time, I realized that the animation felt slightly monotonous when observed passively. The lack of interaction made the "creatures" seem robotic, as if executing a preset loop rather than reacting to stimuli. I decided to introduce a simple **hover interaction** to break this artificial feeling.

> üí° When the user hovers the mouse over any `Ring`, it immediately contracts, mimicking a creature‚Äôs instinctive recoil when startled or touched.

---

### 2. üëÜ Second Iteration ‚Äì Hover Interaction Implemented

![Preview](assets/Iteration2.GIF)

Adding hover-based contraction brought more life into the rings and introduced a reactive element. However, I soon realized the emotion still lacked intensity. The contraction alone resembled a twitch, but failed to convey deeper discomfort or distress.

To amplify the emotional expression, I combined `random()` and `lerpColor()`‚Äîso that the rings not only shrank when hovered, but also shifted color toward deep blues and purples. This created the impression of **suffocation or near-death**, heightening the overall anxiety embedded in the visual language.

### 3. ‚úÖ Final Iteration ‚Äì Complete Emotional and Interactive Layer

![Preview](assets/Final.GIF)

This final iteration represents the complete integration of visual evolution, interactivity, and emotional depth. The combination of dynamic color shifts, recoil motion, and unsettling vibrancy achieves my intended effect: an artwork that‚Äôs both mesmerizing and quietly disturbing.
